Fox and Hounds

Fox and Hounds is a board game using a chess or checkers board. 
The hounds start on one side and the fox on the other. The four hounds are
placed on the black squares and may only move diagonally forward one square.
The fox may move diagonally forward and backwards one square; the fox 
is placed in the left most corner opposite of the hounds. Once the fox moves
past the hounds the fox then wins. If the hounds corner the fox then the hounds
win. For more detail see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_games#Fox_and_Hounds

This is a personal project for me to practise coding, C++, using Git and GitHub and doing some stuff that isn't school work.
